# BFS_DFS_GraphPractice
### A pure practice about BFS and DFS. 
### Edges are adding up between points and the algorithm is able to find out the shortest path (DFS) and determine if one particular node is part of a circle.
 * "Graph.java" is the only source code file.
 * The other two files both work as testers. The file named "CrazyTester3" is the third (final) version of the tester I modified from the original tester, which contains more nodes and edges to make sure the algorithm works.
